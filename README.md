# igniteui-angular-i18n

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular-i18n.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular-i18n)

## Purpose

This respository stores resource strings for the Ignite UI for Angular `i18n`. The English resource strings and the interfaces for each localizable component's `resourceStrings` property are stored in the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) repository. The interfaces can be used as a schema for creating custom resource strings.

## File Usage

An npm package will be produced and it could be referenced alongside with the igniteui-angular in the clients' projects.

## Branches

The branching scheme must follow the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) branching. In order to get the correct resource strings the `igniteui-angular` and `igniteui-angular-i18n` packages should have the same version in the clients' projects.
